    <p>Just a short, totally scenic drive west of Sydney is the World Heritage-listed Blue Mountains National Park. You already know this place looks blue because of the oils from all the eucalyptus trees, but seeing it in person is a total mind-blower! This is a must-visit for any nature lover or anyone who wants an awesome Instagram post!</p>

    <p>Your first stop has to be Echo Point to see the iconic Three Sisters rock formation beacuse the views over the Jamison Valley are breathtaking and perfect for your insta post. If you love exploring, this place is covered in amazing tracks. You can find some super cool lookouts and check out awesome waterfalls like Wentworth Falls. If you’re feeling extra brave, look into a canyoning or abseiling tour because it’s the ultimate adventure level-up! Plus, the cute little towns nearby are perfect for finding cool vintage clothes or grabbing a coffee. </p>
    <p>These tips I actually got from a local friend called John Hensel! (didn’t had time last time I was in Australia)</p>
