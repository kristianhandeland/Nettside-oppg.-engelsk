    <h2>Sydney</h2>
    <p>If you want the big city vibe like New York, but with beaches and palm trees. Sydney is the place to go! It has it all!</p>

    <p>Sydney is such an exciting city with so much to do! The Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge are something you must see, and the views around Circular Quay are amazing. Bondi Beach is perfect if you like surfing or just chilling in the sun, and you can also walk the Bondi to Coogee coastal trail for awesome ocean views. </p>
    <p>The city is also full of cool food spots, from fish and chips by the water to trendy cafes. If you want a break from the busy streets, check out the Royal Botanic Gardenns because they’re very chill and also right next to the harbour.</p>

    <p>A personal recomendation is to go and visit manly beach, especially if you don’t like crowded beaches but still want the same surf summer vibe ☀️ and what I remberber best from when I were there was the sushi rolls they sell on the go! You need to try one!</p>
