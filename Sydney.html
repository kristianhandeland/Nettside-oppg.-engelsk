    <p>Sydney is such an exciting city with so much to do! The Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge are must-sees, and the views around Circular Quay are amazing. Bondi Beach is perfect if you like surfing or just chilling in the sun, and you can even walk the Bondi to Coogee coastal trail for awesome ocean views. </p>
