    <p>If you travel about two hours up the road from Sydney, you get to Newcastle! It is like a mini version of Syndey, but much more chill were you get more of a “non-tourist” vibe.  </p>
    <p>Here in New Castle, you kind of get the vibe that you’re a local, and there is amazing beaches and piknik spots but without all the city and tourism rush that it is in Sydney.  </p>
